# Analyzing_pharmaceutical_medicine_using_Matplotlib

## Summary

In this project I utilized the pandas, matplotlib and scipy.stats libraries to process and analyze two csv files consisting of informtion regarding sample sizes of mice and their tumors.

More specifcially, utilziing matplotlib and scipy.stats, I was able to create visulaztion charts showing different calcutions pertaining to the success of specfic pharmacuetical drugs in relationship to the tumor sizes in the mice. 

##Findings:

1. Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the tumor size better.

2.  There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, it is 0.84. As the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases too.

3. The bar graph shows that Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested.
