# Analyzing_pharmaceutical_medicine_using_Matplotlib

## Summary

In this project, I utilized pandas, matplotlib, and scipy.stats libraries to process and analyze two CSV files consisting of information regarding sample sizes of mice and their tumors.

More specifically, utilizing matplotlib and scipy.stats, I was able to create visualization charts showing different calculations pertaining to the success of specific pharmaceutical drugs in relation to the tumor sizes in the mice.

## Findings:

1. Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the tumor size better.

2.  There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume, it is 0.84. As the mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases too.

3. The bar graph shows that Capomulin and Ramicane had the most number of mice tested.
